# Pi Digit Frequency Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes the frequency of digits in the first several digits of Pi and visualizes the distribution of these digits using bar charts. It fetches Pi digits from an external API, processes them to count the occurrence of each digit, and generates a graphical representation of the results. The tool helps to understand the distribution of digits in Pi and can be extended for further numerical analysis.
